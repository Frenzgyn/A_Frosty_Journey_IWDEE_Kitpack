## <a name="versions" id="versions"></a>Version History

##### Version 2.92 &nbsp;(June 11, 2018)

- Fixed some issue with the mercenary kit not getting the correct bonuses listed.

## 

##### Version 2.91 &nbsp;(December 24, 2016)

- Reduced the Giant Killer's bonuses.
- Improved some of the kit biographies.

## 

##### Version 2.9 &nbsp;(July 6, 2016)

- Fixed some bugs (that meant a conflict with the IWD NPC mod).

## 

##### Version 2.8.1 &nbsp;(January 19, 2016)

- Hopefully fixed a minor dialogue bug with Lysan's dialogue.

## 

##### Version 2.8 &nbsp;(January 19, 2016)

- Changed the Paladin kits so that they have more unique names.
- Fixed some minor dialogue restrictions with Lysan's dialogue that had not been initially properly implemented (only relevant to a Priest of Auril character with the dialogue pack installed).
- Changed the Divinate of Mystra so that it instead has access to Lay on Hands and gains +2 to its save vs spells at level 1. As a consequence it no longer has spellglow (which was horribly overpowered given AI limitations).

## 

##### Version 2.72 &nbsp;(April 7, 2015)

- Changed the status of the Russian version to Beta status due to a bug present with v2.71.

## 

##### Version 2.71 &nbsp;(March 10, 2015)

- Fixed issues with the Russian version that were causing it not to function properly.

## 

##### Version 2.7 &nbsp;(March 8, 2015)

- Added in the Treetender kit.
- Fixed issues resulting from the 1.4 patch for IWDEE.
- Fixed issues with the Russian version.

## 

##### Version 2.6 &nbsp;(February 17, 2015)

- Fixed issues with the Russian version.

## 

##### Version 2.5 &nbsp;(February 17, 2015)

- Fixed an error that was causing Tunnelrats to run around panicked.

## 

##### Version 2.4 &nbsp;(February 17, 2015)

- Fixed an error in the TRA file.
- Added Russian language.

## 

##### Version 2.3 &nbsp;(February 16, 2015)

- Fixed an error in the TRA file.

## 

##### Version 2.2 &nbsp;(February 14, 2015)

- Fixed an error in the TRA file and prepared the mod for possible Russian translation.

## 

##### Version 2.1 &nbsp;(February 14, 2015)

- Fixed an error in the TRA file and prepared the mod for possible Russian translation.

## 

##### Version 2.1 &nbsp;(December 23, 2014)

- Just corrected some minor spelling issues.

## 

##### Version 2.0 &nbsp;(December 12, 2014)

- Corrected a bug with the Divinate of Ilmater that saw its Champion's Strength ability being mislabeled.
- Corrected a bug that saw the Tunnelrat not getting enough of a damage boost towards humanoids (it was only getting +1 rather than +3).
- Introduced the Monk of the Shimmering Wind, Monk of the Shining Hand, Monk of the Weeping Friars and Zealot of the Written Word monk kits.
- Introduced the Mouseburglar, Pest Controller, Scout, Tumbler, and Vermin Slayer thief kits.
- Did some internal moving around of folders to make it clearer for other modders (and frankly myself) what each folder was for.
- Changed flags for a number of innate abilities to ensure they are castable when silenced and ignored wild magic zones (the latter of these is more to ensure compatibility with any future mod that might add these).

## 

##### Version 1.5 &nbsp;(November 25, 2014)

- Corrected a bug with the Disciple of the Phoenix that saw it being granted Lay on Hands too early.
- Introduced the Disciple of the White Rod, the Disciple of the Yielding Way, the Disciple of Old Order and the Monk of the Order of the Long Death.

## 

##### Version 1.4 Beta &nbsp;(November 24, 2014)

- Added in new dialogue for Icepriests of Auril (specifically for Erevain, Grisella, Hrothgar, Pomab, Hermit, and Nate). Improved the compatibility of the existing Lysan dialogue.

## 

##### Version 1.3.7 Beta &nbsp;(November 21, 2014)

## 

##### Version 1.2.1 Beta &nbsp;(November 19, 2014)
